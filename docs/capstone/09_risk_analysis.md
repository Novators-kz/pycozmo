## 🔴 Critical Risks (High Probability, High Impact)

### 1. Hardware Connectivity Issues
**Description**: Students unable to connect to Cozmo robots due to WiFi, driver, or configuration problems.

**Likelihood**: 90% - Almost every team will experience this
**Impact**: High - Can block all development work
**Timeline Impact**: 1-3 days per occurrence

#### Symptoms:
- Cannot connect to Cozmo's WiFi network
- Connection drops frequently
- Robot appears unresponsive to commands
- Inconsistent behavior across different laptops

#### Root Causes:
- WiFi driver compatibility issues
- Firewall/antivirus blocking UDP communication
- Multiple WiFi adapters causing conflicts
- Robot firmware version mismatches
- Network interference in lab environment

#### Mitigation Strategies:

**Preventive Measures**:
```bash
# Pre-project checklist (implement in Week 1)
□ Test all laptops with robot connectivity
□ Document working WiFi adapter models
□ Create standard development environment with Docker
□ Establish "golden" laptop configurations
□ Set up troubleshooting guide with screenshots
```

**Detection & Response**:
```python
# Connectivity monitoring script
# File: tools/connection_monitor.py

import pycozmo
import time
import logging
from typing import Optional

class ConnectivityMonitor:
    """Monitor and report connection issues."""
    
    def __init__(self, timeout: float = 10.0):
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.connection_log = []
        
    def test_connection(self) -> bool:
        """Test basic connectivity to robot."""
        try:
            with pycozmo.connect(timeout=self.timeout) as cli:
                # Simple test command
                cli.set_head_angle(0.0)
                return True
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Connection failed: {e}")
            return False
    
    def run_diagnostic(self) -> dict:
        """Run comprehensive connectivity diagnostic."""
        results = {
            'wifi_scan': self._scan_cozmo_networks(),
            'ping_test': self._ping_robot(),
            'port_test': self._test_udp_ports(),
            'connection_test': self.test_connection()
        }
        return results
        
    def _scan_cozmo_networks(self) -> list:
        """Scan for Cozmo WiFi networks."""
        # Implementation for WiFi scanning
        pass
```

**Immediate Response Protocol**:
1. **First 15 minutes**: Use standardized troubleshooting checklist
2. **If unresolved**: Switch to backup laptop with known working configuration
3. **If still failing**: Use instructor's "golden" laptop for demonstration
4. **Document issue**: Add to team troubleshooting log for future reference

**Backup Plans**:
- **Simulator Mode**: PyCozmo can run in simulation for algorithm development
- **Shared Robot Time**: Teams share working robots during connectivity issues
- **Backup Hardware**: Maintain 2-3 spare Cozmos with known-good configurations

---

### 2. Development Environment Problems
**Description**: Inconsistent Python environments, dependency conflicts, or IDE configuration issues.

**Likelihood**: 85% - Most teams will face environment issues
**Impact**: High - Blocks coding and testing
**Timeline Impact**: 2-4 hours per issue

#### Symptoms:
- ImportError messages for PyCozmo or dependencies
- Different behavior across team member machines
- Version conflicts between libraries
- IDE not recognizing PyCozmo modules

#### Root Causes:
- Inconsistent Python versions across team
- Missing or conflicting package versions
- Path configuration problems
- IDE-specific configuration issues

#### Mitigation Strategies:

**Standardized Environment Setup**:
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for consistent development environment
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /workspace

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git \
    build-essential \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy requirements
COPY requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt ./

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install PyCozmo in development mode
COPY . .
RUN pip install -e .

CMD ["bash"]
```

**Environment Validation Script**:
```python
# File: tools/validate_environment.py

import sys
import importlib
import subprocess
from typing import List, Tuple

def validate_environment() -> List[Tuple[str, bool, str]]:
    """Validate development environment setup."""
    checks = []
    
    # Python version check
    python_version = sys.version_info
    python_ok = python_version >= (3, 8)
    checks.append(("Python 3.8+", python_ok, f"Found {python_version}"))
    
    # Required packages
    required_packages = [
        'pycozmo', 'numpy', 'Pillow', 'cv2', 'pytest'
    ]
    
    for package in required_packages:
        try:
            importlib.import_module(package)
            checks.append((f"{package} import", True, "OK"))
        except ImportError as e:
            checks.append((f"{package} import", False, str(e)))
    
    # Robot connectivity test (optional)
    try:
        import pycozmo
        # Quick connection test with timeout
        with pycozmo.connect(timeout=5.0) as cli:
            checks.append(("Robot connectivity", True, "Connected"))
    except:
        checks.append(("Robot connectivity", False, "No robot found"))
    
    return checks

if __name__ == "__main__":
    results = validate_environment()
    
    print("Environment Validation Results:")
    print("=" * 40)
    
    all_passed = True
    for check_name, passed, details in results:
        status = "✅ PASS" if passed else "❌ FAIL"
        print(f"{status}: {check_name} - {details}")
        if not passed:
            all_passed = False
    
    if all_passed:
        print("\n🎉 Environment validation successful!")
    else:
        print("\n⚠️  Environment issues detected. Please fix before continuing.")
        sys.exit(1)
```

**Response Protocol**:
1. **Run validation script** to identify specific issues
2. **Use Docker environment** if local setup continues failing
3. **Pair with working team member** for urgent development needs
4. **Schedule dedicated environment setup session** with instructor

        except FileNotFoundError:
            pass  # Start with empty task list
```

**Weekly Health Check Process**:
1. **Workload Balance Review**: Check task distribution across team
2. **Blocker Identification**: Review stuck or delayed tasks
3. **Communication Assessment**: Anonymous team health survey
4. **Process Adjustment**: Modify workflows based on feedback

### 4. Scope Creep and Feature Inflation
**Description**: Projects growing beyond original scope, adding too many features, or pursuing overly ambitious goals.

**Likelihood**: 75% - Academic projects often experience scope creep
**Impact**: High - Leads to missed deadlines and incomplete core features
**Timeline Impact**: Can cause 2-4 week delays

#### Symptoms:
- Constantly adding new "small" features
- Core features remain incomplete while working on extras
- Demos focus on flashy features rather than solid implementation
- Team members working on different visions of the project

#### Root Causes:
- Unclear project scope definition
- Student enthusiasm for new ideas
- Competitive pressure with other teams
- Lack of prioritization framework
- Insufficient instructor oversight

#### Mitigation Strategies:

**Scope Definition Framework**:
```markdown
# Project Scope Definition Template

## Core Features (Must Have - 60% of effort)
These features are essential for project success and must be completed:
- [ ] Feature 1: [Description] - [Estimated effort]
- [ ] Feature 2: [Description] - [Estimated effort]
- [ ] Feature 3: [Description] - [Estimated effort]

## Enhanced Features (Should Have - 30% of effort)
These features add significant value but are not critical:
- [ ] Feature A: [Description] - [Estimated effort]
- [ ] Feature B: [Description] - [Estimated effort]

## Stretch Features (Could Have - 10% of effort)
These features are desirable but only if time permits:
- [ ] Feature X: [Description] - [Estimated effort]
- [ ] Feature Y: [Description] - [Estimated effort]

## Out of Scope (Will Not Have)
Explicitly excluded to maintain focus:
- Feature Z: [Reason for exclusion]
- Feature W: [Reason for exclusion]

## Scope Change Process
1. New feature request must be documented with effort estimate
2. Team discussion to classify as Core/Enhanced/Stretch/Out-of-scope
3. If Core or Enhanced, identify what current feature will be moved down
4. Instructor approval required for any Core feature changes
5. Maximum 1 scope change per sprint allowed
```

**Feature Prioritization Matrix**:
```python
# File: tools/feature_prioritizer.py

from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

@dataclass
class Feature:
    """Feature with effort and value estimates."""
    name: str
    effort_estimate: int  # 1-10 scale
    value_to_users: int   # 1-10 scale
    technical_risk: int   # 1-10 scale (higher = riskier)
    learning_value: int   # 1-10 scale
    
    @property
    def priority_score(self) -> float:
        """Calculate priority score (higher = more priority)."""
        # Value / (Effort * Risk) with learning bonus
        base_score = (self.value_to_users + self.learning_value/2) / (self.effort_estimate * (self.technical_risk/5))
        return base_score

class FeaturePrioritizer:
    """Help teams prioritize features objectively."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.features: List[Feature] = []
    
    def add_feature(self, feature: Feature):
        """Add feature for prioritization."""

        efforts = [f.effort_estimate for f in self.features]
        values = [f.value_to_users for f in self.features]
        names = [f.name for f in self.features]
        
        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
        plt.scatter(efforts, values, s=100, alpha=0.7)
        
        for i, name in enumerate(names):
            plt.annotate(name, (efforts[i], values[i]), 
                        xytext=(5, 5), textcoords='offset points')
        
        plt.xlabel('Effort Estimate (1-10)')
        plt.ylabel('Value to Users (1-10)')
        plt.title('Feature Prioritization Matrix')
        plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
        
        # Add quadrant lines
        plt.axhline(y=5, color='gray', linestyle='--', alpha=0.5)
        plt.axvline(x=5, color='gray', linestyle='--', alpha=0.5)
        
        # Add quadrant labels
        plt.text(2, 8, 'Quick Wins\n(High Value, Low Effort)', 
                bbox=dict(boxstyle="round,pad=0.3", facecolor="lightgreen"))
        plt.text(8, 8, 'Major Projects\n(High Value, High Effort)', 
                bbox=dict(boxstyle="round,pad=0.3", facecolor="lightyellow"))
        plt.text(2, 2, 'Fill-ins\n(Low Value, Low Effort)',

                bbox=dict(boxstyle="round,pad=0.3", facecolor="lightcoral"))
        
        plt.show()
```

**Scope Control Process**:
1. **Weekly Scope Review**: Examine feature additions and changes
2. **Effort Tracking**: Monitor actual vs estimated effort for features
3. **Demo Discipline**: Only demo completed core features
4. **Instructor Checkpoints**: Weekly scope validation with instructor

## 🟡 Medium-High Impact Risks

### 5. Performance Bottlenecks
**Description**: AI algorithms, computer vision, or robot control running too slowly for real-time operation.

**Likelihood**: 70% - Performance optimization is challenging
**Impact**: Medium - Affects user experience but not core functionality
**Timeline Impact**: 1-2 weeks of optimization work

#### Common Bottlenecks:
- Computer vision processing taking >100ms per frame
- Emotion/behavior updates causing robot stuttering
- Memory leaks in long-running processes
- Inefficient algorithms in tight loops

#### Mitigation Strategies:

**Performance Monitoring**:
```python
# File: tools/performance_monitor.py

import time
import psutil
import functools
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import Dict, List

class PerformanceMonitor:
    """Monitor system performance and identify bottlenecks."""

                execution_time = end_time - start_time
                self.timing_data[name].append(execution_time)

        return "\n".join(report)

# Global monitor instance
perf_monitor = PerformanceMonitor()

# Usage example:
@perf_monitor.time_function("face_detection")
def detect_faces(image):
    # Face detection implementation
    pass
```

**Optimization Strategies**:
1. **Algorithm Optimization**: Use faster algorithms (e.g., Haar cascades vs DNN)
2. **Frame Rate Adaptation**: Dynamically adjust processing rate based on performance
3. **Threading**: Separate vision processing from robot control
4. **Caching**: Cache expensive computations when possible

---

### 6. Integration Complexity
**Description**: Difficulty combining multiple systems (AI, vision, robot control) into cohesive application.

**Likelihood**: 65% - Integration is inherently complex
**Impact**: Medium - Can delay final demonstration
**Timeline Impact**: 1-2 weeks additional integration work

#### Mitigation Strategies:

**Integration Testing Framework**:
```python
# File: tests/integration_tests.py

import pytest
import time
import threading
from unittest.mock import Mock
import pycozmo

class TestSystemIntegration:
    """Integration tests for complete system."""
    
    def test_vision_to_behavior_pipeline(self):
        """Test complete pipeline from vision to robot behavior."""

        # Test pipeline
        test_image = self._create_test_image_with_face()
        
        # Vision processing
        faces = face_detector.detect_faces(test_image)
        assert len(faces) > 0, "Face detection failed"

## 🟠 High Impact, Medium Probability Risks

### 8. Robot Hardware Failures
**Description**: Physical damage to robots, battery degradation, or component failures.

**Likelihood**: 40% - Hardware failures happen occasionally
**Impact**: High - Can block team completely
**Timeline Impact**: 1-3 days while obtaining replacement

#### Mitigation Strategies:

**Preventive Maintenance**:
- Weekly battery health checks
- Physical inspection for wear/damage
- Backup robot allocation (1 spare per 3 active robots)
- Robot sharing protocols between teams

**Failure Response Protocol**:
1. **Immediate**: Switch to backup robot or share with another team
2. **Short-term**: Use simulator mode for continued development
3. **Long-term**: Request replacement hardware through instructor

---

### 9. Academic Timeline Pressure
**Description**: Midterms, other course projects, or university events creating scheduling conflicts.

**Likelihood**: 50% - Academic calendars often have conflicts
**Impact**: High - Can compress available development time
**Timeline Impact**: 1-2 weeks reduced productivity

#### Mitigation Strategies:

**Academic Calendar Integration**:
- Map Capstone timeline against university academic calendar
- Identify high-risk periods (midterms, finals, major holidays)
- Build buffer time into sprint planning
- Adjust sprint intensity based on academic load

**Workload Management**:
- Flexible sprint goals that can adapt to team availability
- Cross-training so any team member can cover critical tasks
- Automated testing and deployment to reduce manual work
- Emergency "minimum viable" versions of each sprint

---

## ⚫ Low Probability, High Impact Risks

### 11. Major Library/Framework Changes
**Description**: Breaking changes in PyCozmo, OpenCV, or other critical dependencies.

**Likelihood**: 20% - Major changes are uncommon during semester
**Impact**: High - Could require significant code rewrites
**Timeline Impact**: 1-2 weeks of rework

#### Mitigation Strategies:

**Version Pinning**:
```python
# requirements.txt with pinned versions
pycozmo==0.8.0
opencv-python==4.5.3.56
numpy==1.21.0
Pillow==8.3.1
```

**Compatibility Testing**:
- Test against multiple library versions during development
- Maintain compatibility shims for version differences
- Monitor upstream changelogs for breaking changes
