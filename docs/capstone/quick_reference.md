# Connect to robot
client = pycozmo.Client()
client.start()
client.wait_for_robot()

# Move and interact
client.drive_wheels(50, 50, duration=2.0)  # Forward 2 seconds
client.set_head_angle(0.5)  # Look up
client.display_image(image)  # Show image
client.play_anim("anim_gotosleep_off_01")  # Play animation
```

## üë• Team Roles

### Technical Roles
- **Tech Lead**: Architecture, integration, technical decisions
- **AI Engineer**: Computer vision, machine learning, personality engine
- **Robotics Engineer**: Hardware control, sensors, movement algorithms
- **UI Developer**: Display interface, user interaction, animations

### Support Roles  
- **Research Specialist**: Literature review, documentation, testing
- **Project Manager**: Planning, coordination, risk management (optional)

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Network & Connection Problems
- **Issue**: Robot won't connect to Cozmo WiFi
- **Solution**: Check Cozmo battery, reset WiFi, verify IP range (192.168.42.x)

- **Issue**: Lost internet when connecting to Cozmo
- **Solution**: ‚ú® **NEW FEATURE**: Use PyCozmo's built-in dual network manager OR set up manual dual network (USB WiFi adapter OR virtual network adapter)

- **Issue**: Can't access both Cozmo and internet simultaneously
- **Solution**: Use network bridging or secondary adapter for dedicated Cozmo connection

**Quick Network Setup**:
```bash
# NEW: Automatic dual network management
python -c "import pycozmo; pycozmo.configure_cozmo_network('Cozmo_12345')"

# Verify automatic setup
python -c "import pycozmo; print(pycozmo.get_network_status())"

# Manual verification (if needed)
ip addr show                    # Linux
ipconfig /all                  # Windows

# Test Cozmo connectivity
ping 192.168.42.1              # Cozmo default IP
python -c "import pycozmo; print('PyCozmo available')"
```

### Development Environment
- **Issue**: PyCozmo installation fails
- **Solution**: Use virtual environment, check Python version (3.7+), install dependencies

### Performance Issues
- **Issue**: Slow robot response
- **Solution**: Optimize code, reduce image processing load, check wireless interference

### Team Coordination
- **Issue**: Merge conflicts, unclear responsibilities
- **Solution**: Use feature branches, follow team_roles.md, regular standups
